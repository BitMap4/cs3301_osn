# Mini Project 0 : Intro to System Calls
Welcome everyone to your very first Mini Project in Operating Systems & Networks Course. This Mini Project is designed to give you a basic introduction to system calls and to give you an idea of what and how you will be working with in the coming Mini Projects.
A system call is a routine that allows a user application to request actions that require special privileges. Adding system calls is one of several ways to extend the functions provided by the kernel.
